# cambiacosas

cambiacosas is a super cool tool that does amazing things! (Well, not really amazing things yet, but we're working on it!).

It's a simple command-line tool built with Python that currently takes two arguments and... well, it prints them out.  But hey, everyone starts somewhere, right?

Under the hood, it's got a `src/cambiacosas` directory which is where all the magic (and by magic, we mean code) lives.  Inside you'll find:

- `__main__.py`: This is the main entry point of the tool.  Run it with `python -m cambiacosas` and see what happens (spoiler: not much yet!).
- `administracion_archivo/`:  This directory sounds fancy, like it manages files or something.  Probably will be important later!

For now, cambiacosas is more of a "cambia-nada" but stay tuned for updates!
