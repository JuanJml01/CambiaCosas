# Documentation for `__init__.py` in `src/cambiacosas/`

## File: `__init__.py`

This file is located in the `src/cambiacosas/` directory and would serve as an initialization file for the `cambiacosas` package if it existed. Currently, it appears this file does not exist in the project.

### Purpose (Hypothetical):

-   **Package Initialization:**  If present, this `__init__.py` file would mark the `cambiacosas` directory as a Python package. This is essential for allowing other parts of the project or external code to import `cambiacosas` and its submodules as a package.
-   **Namespace Definition:** It would define the namespace for the `cambiacosas` package. Any symbols defined in this `__init__.py` would be directly accessible under the `cambiacosas` namespace.
-   **Module Import Control:**  Similar to other `__init__.py` files, it could control which modules and subpackages are imported when `cambiacosas` package is imported, especially when using wildcard imports.
-   **Setup Code:**  If needed, this file could contain package-level initialization code, such as setting up configurations, initializing resources, or any other setup required when the `cambiacosas` package is loaded.

### Content (Non-existent file):

Currently, there is no `__init__.py` file in the `src/cambiacosas/` directory. This means that while `src/cambiacosas/` can still contain modules (like `__main__.py` and the `administracion_archivo` subdirectory), it is not formally recognized as a Python package itself. To make `cambiacosas` a package, you would need to create this `__init__.py` file.

### How to create it (if needed):

To make `src/cambiacosas/` a package, you would create an empty file named `__init__.py` inside the `src/cambiacosas/` directory. You can then add initialization code or namespace definitions as needed.

**Example of creating an empty `__init__.py` file:**

You can create an empty `__init__.py` file using the following command in the terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
touch src/cambiacosas/__init__.py
```

After creating this file, `src/cambiacosas/` would be recognized as a Python package.

### Usage (Hypothetical, after creation):

Once `__init__.py` is created, you could import the `cambiacosas` package and its modules in other parts of your code:

```python
import cambiacosas
from cambiacosas import administracion_archivo
```

This would allow for a more structured and modular project design, especially if `cambiacosas` was intended to be a larger, reusable component.
