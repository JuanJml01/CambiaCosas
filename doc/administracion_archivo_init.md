# Documentation for `__init__.py` in `src/cambiacosas/administracion_archivo/`

## File: `__init__.py`

This file is located in the `src/cambiacosas/administracion_archivo/` directory and serves as an initialization file for the `administracion_archivo` package.

### Purpose:

-   **Package Initialization:** In Python, the `__init__.py` file is used to mark directories as Python packages. When a directory contains an `__init__.py` file, Python recognizes it as a package, allowing you to import modules and subpackages from it.
-   **Namespace Definition:** It defines the namespace for the package. This means that when you import the package, the symbols defined in `__init__.py` (if any) become available directly under the package name.
-   **Module Import Control:**  `__init__.py` can be used to control which modules and subpackages are imported when the package is imported using a wildcard (`from package import *`).
-   **Setup Code:** It can contain initialization code that should be executed when the package is first imported. This might include setting up logging, initializing variables, or performing other setup tasks.

### Content:

Currently, this `__init__.py` file is empty. This is common when the primary purpose of the file is simply to mark the directory as a package, and no specific initialization code or namespace definitions are needed at the package level.

### Usage:

Even though it is empty, its presence is crucial for Python to recognize `src/cambiacosas/administracion_archivo/` as a package. You can import modules from this package in other parts of your code:

```python
from src.cambiacosas.administracion_archivo import file_info
from src.cambiacosas.administracion_archivo import edit_file
```

In this case, `__init__.py` ensures that `file_info` and `edit_file` modules within the `administracion_archivo` directory can be correctly imported and used as part of the package.
